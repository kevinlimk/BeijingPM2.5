# ChinaPM2.5

This study aims to use recorded PM2.5 concentration data in Beijing along with weather data and transportation data to create a machine learning model that can predict PM2.5 concentration. Such a model could provide citizens a means of anticipating fluctuations in air quality in order to minimize their exposure to air pollutants on days with especially high PM2.5 concentration levels.
