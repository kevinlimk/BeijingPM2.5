# ChinaPM2.5

This study aims to use recorded PM2.5 concentration data in Beijing along with weather data and transportation data to create a machine learning model that can predict PM2.5 concentration. Such a model could be used to provide forecasts of PM2.5 concentration based on weather forecasts and annual trends in transportation, thereby providing citizens a means of preparing for fluctuations in air quality.
